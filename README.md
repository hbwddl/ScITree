# ScTree
ScTree: R package for scalable and robust mechanistic integration of epidemiological and genomic data for transmission tree inference 
  
This repository contains the R package (developed with Rcpp) to fit the ScTree method.

Load the ScTree.Rproj file, then build the package and install.

An example script, which will run the inference on your own machine, is in test/simulation_inference_analysis.R
